Results are paginated (see the output schema and also the PaginatedDto where "results" is an array of ClinicalTrial).
                    <ul>
                        <li>count - the total number of results found in the database by this query.</li>
                        <li>query - an object with all input filter parameters</li>
                        <li>results - an array of ClinicalSite, with at most query.limit elements, starting at page query.page.</li>
                    </ul>
                    (The PaginatedDto is a breaking change from previous version).
                    <p>The name and description properties have been moved out of ClinicalTrual.dsuData and are now top level properties. (This is also a breaking change).</p>
                </li>
                <li><a href="/borest/api/#/Authentication/AuthController_login">POST /borest/auth/login</a> now accepts an optional type parameter.
                    If the type parameter its present, then its value must match the type parameter given in the POST /borest/auth/signup for that user.
                    Future releases may make this parameter <span style="font-weight: bold;">mandatory</span>.
                    No changes done to POST /borest/auth/get/current and neither to the JWT payload which contains only the id and username properties.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For ease of testing/development</span>, authentication is turned off on /borest/ctrial/location, clinicaltrial and clinicaltrialstatus services, for the time being.</p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggestion</span> to implement the search for clinical trials:
            <ul>
                <li>Use /borest/ctrial/location filtered by center=true to have a list of major city centers, as the starting location for the travel distance.</li>
                <li>Use /borest/ctrial/clinicaltrialstatus to have a list of the ClinicalTrial lifecycle status. (Probably not all status are visible to all actors, but for now, this may be ignored).</li>
                <li>There is no list of medical conditions. To perform a search of clinical trials by medical condition, PDM suggests filtering by description.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Backoffice apps updated with Prateek's signup feature.</p>

        <p>The data about the institutions listed (univesities and hospitals) is public, but has been used for development purposes <span style="font-weight: bold;">without their permission</span>.</p>

        <h2>v0.2.6 Release notes 2021-05-13</h2>
        
        <p><a href="/borest/api">OpenAPI</a> changes:
            <ul>
                <li>POST /borest/auth/signup - has new mandatory parameter type, with possible values ClinicalSiteUser, PhysicianUser, SponsorUser. Fixed input schema documentation.</li>
                <li>GET /borest/ctrial/clinicaltrial - (experimental) list of clinical trials. No exclusion criteria, all trials are listed. The "name" and "description" properties are inside the dsuData object. Missing multiple ClinicalSite associations (it should be an array, not a single propert).</li>
                <li>Fixed input parameter documentation on GET methods.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Backoffice renamed to App.</p>
        <p>Backoffice app entry links changed to /dashboard?type=UserClass</p>
        <p>Health Information demonstrates a Personal Health Information form, using <a href="http://lhncbc.github.io/lforms/">LForms</a>.
            Health information can be edited, again.
            <br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The user should not be able to access the dashboard
                without saving a updated health information form.</span>
            <br />Pros/Cons identified so far:
            <ul>
                <li>Business</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>+ The library is free, with a BSD-style <a href="https://github.com/lhncbc/lforms/blob/master/LICENSE.md">license</a>.
                    <li>+ The form questions are defineable in JSON format (editable on a text editor).</li>
                    <li>+ There is an open-source code application <a href="https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms">https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms</a> for editing form definitions, and an online-tool to edit the form definitions at <a href="https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/">https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/</a>.</li>
                    <li>+ There is "local" version of that application/tool at <img src="assets/images/formbuilder-h200px.png" style="height: 1em;"> <a href="https//fb-dev.pharmaledger.pdmfc.com">https//fb-dev.pharmaledger.pdmfc.com</a> which provides some confidentiality for the user, provided you don't use external option lists. (<del>- There tool above provides no privacy and no warranty of availability.</del>)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current <span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal Health Information</span> form definition can be downloaded from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PharmaLedger-IMI/ctr-workspace/v0.2.8/ctr-patient/ctr-dsu-wizard/formDefs/ghi.json">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PharmaLedger-IMI/ctr-workspace/v0.2.8/ctr-patient/ctr-dsu-wizard/formDefs/ghi.json</a> and edited on the tool above.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>+ The form capabilities seem powerfull enough (several field types including dates, autocomplete-assisted choices, color customization, horizontal/vertical/grid layouts...).</li>
                    <li>- The design of the displayed form does not match the intended clickeable prototype design, and all the questions need to be displayed at the same time. <span style="font-size: smaller;">(Future developments may fix that, but the effort required is still unestimated).</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Technical</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>- lforms v29.0.3 in patient-ssap v0.2.0 In groups of questions where many items can be added, removing an item (by pressing "-") freezes the browser tab (tested on Firefox and Chrome) and freezes the whole OpenDSU application. (Does not happen on https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/ ). (<span style="color: red;">Critical</span>).</span></p></li>
                    <li>+ Updated frequently.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

    <p>Patient wallet has ePi application replaced by OpenDSU Patient App Skeleton. (On-Going).</p>
