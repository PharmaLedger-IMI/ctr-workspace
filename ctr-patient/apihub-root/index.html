For every question that is not informative there is a "<span style="color: darkgreen;">CRITERIA MATCH</span>" or "<span style="color: red;">CRITERIA REJECT</span>" just below the question). There is an overall status at the end.</li>
        </ol>
        Feel free to repeat the above test for different answers, and/or other condition, such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Psoriatic Arthritis</span> (a much simpler pre-screener, without defined match criteria).

        <p>If you experience wallet loading problems, or some other weird errors, please check if those errors go away by using the browser in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Incognito mode</span>.</p>

        <p>Major Defects (compared to planned M5+M6):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the "Patient Wallet":
                <ul>
                    <li>The match result is not yet communicated back to the patient.</li>
                    <li>The General Health Conditions are not yet used to rule-out trials. (Example: Age under 18 does not exclude any trial from "FIND TRIAL" so far).</li>
                    <li>Browse trials feature is only partially operational.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Few features available to manage submitted match request (just list submitted requests, and check match criteria).</li>
                    <li>No feature to manage trials.</li>
                    <li>There is a question form editor, but it is not integrated in the backoffice. Trial installation, and criteria conditions must configured by a DB technician.</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>v0.3.8 Release notes 2021-06-07</h2>

        General test guidelines (submit a match request, and verify it on the blockchain):
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <img src="assets/images/patient.png" style="height: 1em;"><a href="/patient-ssapp/loader/" target="_blank">Patient Wallet</a>.</li>

            <li>Fill out all the steps until step 4. <br />
                <span style="font-size: smaller;">(Regardless of the medical condition chosen, all the questions in steps 3 and 4 will be related to Rheumatoid Arthritis.)</span>
            </li>
            <li>After the final step, take note of the <span style="color: red;">keySSI</span> given.</li>
            <li>Open the <img src="assets/images/cube.png" style="height: 1em;"><a href="/dsu-explorer/loader/" target="_blank">DSU Explorer</a>.</li>

                    <li>Name the dossier - any filename you choose.</li>
                    <li>Enter Dossier SEED - paste the <span style="color: red;">keySSI</span> shown before.</li>
                    <li>Expand the filename.</li>

        <p><a href="/borest/api">OpenAPI</a> changes:
            <ul>
                <li>In the Schemas section, the ClinicalSite now has an Address.</li>
                <li>In the Schemas section, each Address now has one Location.</li>
                <li>One Location now represents a GPS coordinate.</li>
                <li><a href="/borest/api/#/Location/LocationController_search">GET /borest/ctrial/location</a> - has a number of input parameters</a> which allows to filter results of known GPS locations used in addresses (amongst other locations). Filter by center=true to get only known city centers. Results are paginated. </li>
                <li><a href="/borest/api/#/ClinicalTrialStatus/ClinicalTrialStatusController_findAll">GET /borest/ctrial/clinicaltrialstatus</a> - list all possible trial main-lifecycle status codes. </li>
                <li><a href="/borest/api/#/ClinicalTrial/ClinicalTrialController_search">GET /borest/ctrial/clinicaltrial</a> - has a number of input parameters</a> which allows to filter results of clinical trials. Results are paginated (see the output schema and also the PaginatedDto where "results" is an array of ClinicalTrial).
                    <ul>
                        <li>count - the total number of results found in the database by this query.</li>

                    <p>The name and description properties have been moved out of ClinicalTrual.dsuData and are now top level properties. (This is also a breaking change).</p>

                <li><a href="/borest/api/#/Authentication/AuthController_login">POST /borest/auth/login</a> now accepts an optional type parameter.
                    If the type parameter its present, then its value must match the type parameter given in the POST /borest/auth/signup for that user.
                    Future releases may make this parameter <span style="font-weight: bold;">mandatory</span>.
                    No changes done to POST /borest/auth/get/current and neither to the JWT payload which contains only the id and username properties.</li>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For ease of testing/development</span>, authentication is turned off on /borest/ctrial/location, clinicaltrial and clinicaltrialstatus services, for the time being.</p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggestion</span> to implement the search for clinical trials:
            <ul>
                <li>Use /borest/ctrial/location filtered by center=true to have a list of major city centers, as the starting location for the travel distance.</li>
                <li>Use /borest/ctrial/clinicaltrialstatus to have a list of the ClinicalTrial lifecycle status. (Probably not all status are visible to all actors, but for now, this may be ignored).</li>
                <li>There is no list of medical conditions. To perform a search of clinical trials by medical condition, PDM suggests filtering by description.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Backoffice apps updated with Prateek's signup feature.</p>

        <p>The data about the institutions listed (univesities and hospitals) is public, but has been used for development purposes <span style="font-weight: bold;">without their permission</span>.</p>

        <h2>v0.2.6 Release notes 2021-05-13</h2>
        
        <p><a href="/borest/api">OpenAPI</a> changes:
            <ul>
                <li>POST /borest/auth/signup - has new mandatory parameter type, with possible values ClinicalSiteUser, PhysicianUser, SponsorUser. Fixed input schema documentation.</li>
                <li>GET /borest/ctrial/clinicaltrial - (experimental) list of clinical trials. No exclusion criteria, all trials are listed. The "name" and "description" properties are inside the dsuData object. Missing multiple ClinicalSite associations (it should be an array, not a single propert).</li>
                <li>Fixed input parameter documentation on GET methods.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                <li>Business</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>+ The library is free, with a BSD-style <a href="https://github.com/lhncbc/lforms/blob/master/LICENSE.md">license</a>.
                    <li>+ The form questions are defineable in JSON format (editable on a text editor).</li>
                    <li>+ There is an open-source code application <a href="https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms">https://github.com/lhncbc/formbuilder-lhcforms</a> for editing form definitions, and an online-tool to edit the form definitions at <a href="https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/">https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/</a>.</li>
                    <li>+ There is "local" version of that application/tool at <img src="assets/images/formbuilder-h200px.png" style="height: 1em;"> <a href="https//fb-dev.pharmaledger.pdmfc.com">https//fb-dev.pharmaledger.pdmfc.com</a> which provides some confidentiality for the user, provided you don't use external option lists.

                    </ul>
                    <li>+ The form capabilities seem powerfull enough (several field types including dates, autocomplete-assisted choices, color customization, horizontal/vertical/grid layouts...).</li>
                    <li>- The design of the displayed form does not match the intended clickeable prototype design, and all the questions need to be displayed at the same time. <span style="font-size: smaller;">(Future developments may fix that, but the effort required is still unestimated).</span>.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Technical</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>- lforms v29.0.3 in patient-ssap v0.2.0 In groups of questions where many items can be added, removing an item (by pressing "-") freezes the browser tab (tested on Firefox and Chrome) and freezes the whole OpenDSU application. (Does not happen on https://lhcformbuilder.nlm.nih.gov/ ). (<span style="color: red;">Critical</span>).</span></p></li>
